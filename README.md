Trail-Files üìÇüíª

Trail-Files is a full-stack project designed to manage, analyze, and visualize various types of log and data files in a systematic way. It combines MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for the frontend-backend workflow and uses OpenSearch for fast and advanced search capabilities across files and logs.

This project is perfect for developers, system admins, and analysts who want to organize logs, track system activities, and perform advanced searches efficiently.

üåü Features

Full-Stack Architecture: Built with MERN stack for a smooth, interactive web interface.

Multi-format File Support: Handles CSV, TXT, and other structured or semi-structured logs.

OpenSearch Integration: Provides lightning-fast search across logs, supporting complex queries.

Data Analysis & Reporting: Aggregate logs, detect patterns, and visualize results on the frontend.

Duplicate Detection: Ensures repeated entries are filtered out automatically.

Extensible: Add new file types, search filters, or visualization modules easily.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

MongoDB: Database for storing structured log metadata.

Express.js: Backend framework for API routes and file handling.

React.js: Frontend framework for dynamic dashboards and visualizations.

Node.js: Server environment to run backend services.

OpenSearch: Provides search and analytics capabilities over large log datasets.

Python (optional): Can be used for preprocessing logs before storing in MongoDB or OpenSearch.

üìÇ Example Use Case

Imagine your system generates multiple log files for user activity, errors, or transactions:

Upload log files via the web interface (React frontend).

Backend (Node + Express) processes files and stores metadata in MongoDB.

OpenSearch indexes files for fast search and advanced query operations.

React dashboard visualizes trends, errors, and usage statistics dynamically.

This setup ensures scalable log management with high-performance search and reporting.
